# Mini Hostel API (Core Node.js)

A RESTful API built **without Express** — using only Node.js core `http` and `url` modules.  
This demonstrates how APIs work under the hood.

- `GET /students` → List all students
- `GET /students/:id` → Get student by ID
- `POST /students` → Add a new student
- `PUT /students/:id` → Update student info
- `DELETE /students/:id` → Remove a student
- `GET /rooms/:roomNumber` → Get all students in a room
